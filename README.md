PapaPets Application: Business Application Development Final Project

The PapaPets application was developed to optimize pet store management by streamlining inventory control and sales operations. 
The platform serves both customers and admins. Customers can register, browse available pets, make purchases, 
and view their transaction history, while admins manage pet listings through CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
